The is the source code respository for https://psweb.mp.qub.ac.uk/sne/atlasforced/

This is the ATLAS forced photometry server, which provides full public
access to photometric measurements over the full history of ATLAS
survey. After registration, a user can request forced photometry at
any position on the sky either for a single position or a list of positions.
Currently that is limited to declinations greater than -50 degrees, but will be
all sky when the two new ATLAS units are installed in Chile and South Africa in 2021.
