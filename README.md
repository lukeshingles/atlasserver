This is the source code for https://fallingstar-data.com/forcedphot/

The ATLAS forced photometry server provides public
access to photometric measurements over the full history of the ATLAS
survey. After registration, a user can request forced photometry at
any position on the sky either for a single position or a list of positions.
Currently that is limited to declinations greater than -50 degrees, but will be
all sky when the two new ATLAS units are installed in Chile and South Africa in 2021.
