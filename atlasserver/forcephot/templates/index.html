        <h1>ATLAS Forced Photometry</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This is the <a href="https://fallingstar.com/">ATLAS</a> forced photometry server, which provides full public
        access to photometric measurements over the full history of ATLAS
        survey. After registration, a user can request forced photometry at
        any position on the sky either for a single position or a list of
        positions. Currently that is limited to declinations greater than -50
        degrees, but will be all sky when the two new ATLAS units are
        installed in Chile and South Africa in 2021.</p>

    <p>As described in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130f4505T/abstract">Tonry et al. (2018)</a>,
        ATLAS currently surveys the whole
        visible sky north of -50 degrees every 2 nights. On each of those
        alternate nights a sequence of 4 x 30 second exposures taken, spaced
        over a period of about 1 hour to provide identification and orbit
        constraints for near-earth objects (NEOs). Discovery of NEOs and
        potentially hazardous objects is the main purpose of ATLAS. However
        the all-sky, frequent coverage, to o ~ 19.5 makes it treasure trove
        for time domain science. A full description is on the ATLAS homepage at <a
            href="https://fallingstar.com/">fallingstar.com</a></p>

    <p>The potential for transient object science and variable star science
        has been described in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132h5002S/abstract">Smith et al.
            (2020)</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..241H/abstract">Heinze et al.
            (2018)</a>,
        respectively. We release all our transient discoveries to the
        <a href="https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/">IAU's Transient Name Server</a>.
    </p>

    <p>A forced photometry means that a point-spread-function is calculated
        for each image based on high signal to noise stars, and a profile fit
        is forced at the user's input coordinates. The forced measurement
        can be made on either a target image (e.g. for the measurement of
        flux of a variable star), or on a difference image (e.g. for a
        lightcurve point for a transient). Data processing and photometry
        are described in more detail in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130f4505T/abstract">Tonry
            et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132h5002S/abstract">Smith et al.
            (2020)</a>.</p>

    <p>This work has made use of data from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact
        Last Alert System (ATLAS) project. The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) project is
        primarily funded to search for near earth asteroids through NASA grants NN12AR55G, 80NSSC18K0284, and
        80NSSC18K1575; byproducts of the NEO search include images and catalogs from the survey area. This work was
        partially funded by Kepler/K2 grant J1944/80NSSC19K0112 and HST GO-15889, and STFC grants ST/T000198/1 and
        ST/S006109/1. The ATLAS science products have been made possible through the contributions of the University of
        Hawaii Institute for Astronomy, the Queenâ€™s University Belfast, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the South
        African Astronomical Observatory, and The Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS), Chile.</p>
