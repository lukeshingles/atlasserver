A planned upgrade of the ATLAS server infrastructure will take place on Monday May 15. Requests received late on Monday (UT) will be delayed. Forced photometry is now available from the Southern Telescopes (El Sauce, Chile and Sutherland, South Africa). Please be aware that the difference imaging template south of -50 degrees declination was changed during commissioning, so you may get an unexpected discontinuity in your target's difference lightcurve.
