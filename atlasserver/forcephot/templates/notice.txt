Forced photometry is now available from the Southern Telescopes (El Sauce, Chile and Sutherland, South Africa). Please be aware that the difference imaging template south of -50 degrees declination was changed during commissioning, so you may get an unexpected discontinuity in your target's difference lightcurve.
