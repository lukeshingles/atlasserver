    <h2>Q: What is tphot and why do I get what appears to be unexpected results in red mode?</h2>
    <p>You may encounter negative flux values in difference image analysis. This is understandable when a variable object has been selected, since it may be either brighter or fainter than the template image used for subtraction. In a minority of cases, you may also encounter negative flux  values when requesting “red” mode, when photometry is forced on the target images (before differencing). This will strike you as unexpected, but it is a feature of our <strong>tphot</strong> module. <strong>tphot</strong> is a simple, one object at a time, PSF based photometric measurement and is designed for use on difference images in which one expects to have single, unresolved point sources. If we run this on crowded field target images in which the object is variable it may estimate the sky to be too high due to nearby stars, and as it does not fit multiple PSFs (it was never designed to do so), it may subtract an elevated sky leaving negative flux.  Remember <strong>tphot</strong> is not <strong>dophot</strong>. We are planning full release of target images processed with <strong>dophot</strong> in the future. In the meantime, use the results of <strong>tphot</strong>  with care when running on reduced images. It will give you reliable fluxes and magnitudes most of the time, but be careful with interpretation in crowded fields. The ATLAS pixels are 1.86 arcsec and the FWHM is typically 2 pixels.</p>

    <h2>Q: Why are there step discontinuities in the difference flux lightcurve when requested over a long period of time (e.g. years)?</h2>

    <p>The difference image reference templates are periodically replaced. In order to see whether the step change is real you might want to consider requesting "reduced" (i.e. input) image data. If there are no discontinuities in this lightcurve, the likelihood is that the step features are present because of the template change.</p>
